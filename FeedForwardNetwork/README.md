<b><font size =20> 1) What is a neural network neuron? </font></b> <br/>
      1. A neural network neuron is an unit that holds a weight and an activation function. <br/>
      2. Each neuron has both input and output connection. <br/>
      3. With given weight(w) and activation function(tanh), output of a neuron is calculated as <br/>
      z=tanh(âˆ‘<sup>n</sup><sub>i=1</sub> x<sub>i</sub>w<sub>i</sub>+b)  , where n- number of connections coming in, b- bias <br/>
      4. The activation fnction can be tanh, sigmoid, ReLU, etc.

### 5)  What is the "chain rule" in gradient flow?
