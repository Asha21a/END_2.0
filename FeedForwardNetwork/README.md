### 1) What is a neural network neuron? ##
    <p>  1. A neural network neuron is an unit that holds a weight and an activation function. 
      2. Each neuron has both input and output connection. 
      3. Output of a neuron is calculated as 
      z=tanh(âˆ‘<sup>n</sup><sub>i=1</sub> x<sub>i</sub>w<sub>i</sub>+b)  , n- number of connections, </p>


### 2) What is the use of the learning rate?



### 3) How are weights initialized?



### 4) What is "loss" in a neural network?



### 5)  What is the "chain rule" in gradient flow?
