1, <b>What is a neural network neuron?</b> <br />
      A neural network neuron is an unit that holds a weight and an activation function. <br /> 
      Each neuron has both input and output connection. <br />
      Output of a neuron is calculated as <br />
      z=tanh(âˆ‘<sup>n</sup><sub>i=1</sub> x<sub>i</sub>w<sub>i</sub>+b)  , n- number of connections, 


What is the use of the learning rate?



How are weights initialized?



What is "loss" in a neural network?



What is the "chain rule" in gradient flow?
